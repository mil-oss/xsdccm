   <StandardLicenseTemplate>&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; Multics License&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. as a contribution to computer science knowledge. This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe, and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc.&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; .&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name="divider";original="-----------------------------------------------------------";match="-*"&gt;&gt;
