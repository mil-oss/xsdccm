XML Schema Document Collaborative Configuration Management

This project uses NIEM Conformant Reference XML Schema to autogenerate implementation schema, source code, code tests, validation verification, hash digests, and test data.  These products are included in a National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD).

The objective is to provide procedures and products that can be independently verified in order to ensure compliance with XML defined standards and specifications by mission critical application components.  These core data structures and information exchange components can be employed directly or as external services in order to achieve uniform implementations accross communities which have dynamic interoperabiltiy requirements.
